## Introduction

This is my configuration for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) that I made for myself. It does not claim to be an IDE or anything like that. I use it as a system code editor and, for convenience, I created my own dotfiles for it.

Simply put, this is an experiment. I have never done anything like this before. I created and tested it on Linux, so I am not sure about its full compatibility with other systems. 

## Credits

- [Vimichael](https://github.com/vimichael/my-nvim-config) used his configuration as a basis (starting point) and the color theme was also taken from there.
- [Folke](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) the entire assembly is built on his 💤 lazy plugin manager.
